This project is about building a real-time Mask R-CNN using Detectron. Detectorn2 is the latest Python library for object detection released by the AI Facebook researchersâ€™ team. I have used this repository. The main task was to implement a simple solution to run Detectron Mask R-CNN algorithm for object detection and instance segmentation with webcam. In coding section, I have maintained the following sequential steps:
1. Installation Dependencies and Libraries.
2. Examining the dependencies (pytorch, cuda and detectron2 version).
3. Adding Libraries.
4. Running a pre-trained model.

For object detection and instance segmentation I have used three different strategies are as follows:
1. Object detection and instance segmentation from image captured by webcam.
2. Object detection and instance segmentation from realtime video captured by webcam.
3. Object detection and instance segmentation from youtube video.
